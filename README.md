# CCGA_model
Compare GA and CCGA model and I make an externsion to see if I can get a better result with subgroups.

In this project, I simply reimplement the paper M. A. Potter and K. A. D. Jong, [A cooperative coevolutionary approach to function optimization](https://cs.gmu.edu/~mpotter/pubs/ppsn94.pdf), in PPSN III: Proceedings of the International Conference on Evolutionary Computation. The Third Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature. London, UK:Springer-Verlag, 1994, pp. 249-257.
Also I have done an extension to this paper.
